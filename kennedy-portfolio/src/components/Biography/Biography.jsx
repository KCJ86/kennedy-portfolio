          I hope you enjoyed the art featured on this website. Full credit goes
          to Diego Rivera and the great Jos√© Clemente Orozco, both of whom are
          my countrymen. Being born on the coast of Jalisco, I wanted to
          incorporate elements of my culture into this creation, as it's a big
          part of my identity. Growing up in the Bay Area during the tech boom,
          I witnessed how many underrepresented communities were left behind.
          This fueled my desire to pursue a career in tech to show that more of
          us belong in these spaces. As underrepresented people, we deserve to
          be seen as engineers, not just unskilled laborers. I hope you enjoyed
          exploring my profile, and please feel free to reach out for a
          conversation I am always happy to chat!
